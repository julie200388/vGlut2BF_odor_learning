🔬 Calcium Imaging Data Analysis
Located in: CalciumImaging_dataanalysis/

Scripts for processing .csv output files from Inscopix software containing calcium activity traces per cell. Includes:

-Averaged trace plotting

-Heatmap generation

-Classification of excited, inhibited, and non-responsive cells (odor screening and post-association)

-PCA and correlation matrix analysis

-Euclidean distance calculations for odor representations

🧪 Behavioral Analysis — Go/No-Go Task
MEDPCparser/: Extract behavioral parameters from .txt files generated by MedPC

STDcalculator2/: Calculate d-prime (d′), running-window d-prime, and criterion

SDTcrawl2/: Batch-process all odor pairs and animals for d-prime metrics

dprimeRollingWindow_allmice/: Plot d-prime over time across mice

finaldprime_allmice_allodor/: Compute final d-prime for each odor pair

learningability/: Calculate the number of trials required to reach performance threshold

⚙️ Requirements
MATLAB R2022a or later
